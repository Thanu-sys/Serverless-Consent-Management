## üìù Professional Summary Paragraph

**Privacy Consent Manager - Advanced GDPR Compliance System**

I developed a comprehensive full-stack web application that helps businesses comply with privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA. Built with React 18 frontend featuring modern glass morphism design and Flask backend with RESTful API, this system provides granular consent management, real-time analytics, and beautiful user experience. The application includes a GDPR-compliant cookie consent banner, individual consent toggles, bulk operations, and an analytics dashboard with visual progress bars. Using Python, SQLAlchemy, and modern CSS animations, I created a scalable solution that addresses the growing need for transparent data processing while maintaining excellent user experience. The project demonstrates my expertise in full-stack development, API design, responsive UI/UX, and understanding of privacy compliance requirements.
